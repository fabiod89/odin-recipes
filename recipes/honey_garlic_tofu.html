        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul> 
            <li>1 Package of Superior Tofu’s Organic Extra Firm Tofu</li>
            <li>4 Tablespoons Tamari or Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons Sesame Oil</li>
            <li>4 Tablespoons Honey</li>
            <li>2 Cloves of Garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon of Crushed Red Pepper</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon of Sriracha (add more if you want it extra spicy!)</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons of Olive Oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix all ingredients for the sauce in a medium size bowl and set aside. Cut tofu into bite sized chunks and add to the bowl of sauce. Let the tofu marinate in the sauce for at least 30 minutes. (you can let it sit overnight, too!). </li>
            <li>Once the tofu has been marinating for at least 30 minutes, heat a nonstick skillet on medium to high heat. Add tofu without the marinade to the skillet. Allow each side of the tofu to ‘sear’ and create a crust. When all sides of the tofu are seared, add the marinade and coat the tofu. </li>
            <li>Serve with rice, a sprinkle of sesame seeds and fresh parsley.</li>
        </ol>
